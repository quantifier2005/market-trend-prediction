#  Predictive Analysis of Market Trends

A Streamlit web application for analyzing and predicting **Inflation Rates** using traditional Machine Learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) and Deep Learning (LSTM). Upload your dataset, visualize feature correlations, train models, and download predictions.

##  Features

-  Upload custom economic data in CSV format
-  Visualize correlations using a heatmap
-  Train models:  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - XGBoost  
  - LSTM (Deep Learning)
-  Compare model performance (MAE, MSE, R¬≤)
-  Download predictions as CSV
-  Side-by-side model comparisons

---

##  Dataset Format

Make sure your CSV dataset includes the following:

- `observation_date` ‚Äî column with year/month (e.g., `2001`, `2020-03`, etc.)
- Other columns:  
  e.g., `inflation_rate`, `GDP`, `CPI`, `unemployment_rate`, `interest_rate`, etc.

Example CSV structure:

```csv
observation_date,inflation_rate,GDP,CPI,unemployment_rate
2000,3.2,1000,200,5.1
2001,2.9,1050,205,5.3
```
## Project Stages
### 1.  Data Collection
 -Economic data was collected from the FRED API, including macroeconomic indicators like inflation rate, GDP, CPI, unemployment rate, and interest rate.

### 2.  Data Imputation (Daily Frequency)
 -Missing data points were imputed, and the dataset was resampled to a daily frequency to ensure temporal consistency for time-series modeling.

### 3.  Hourly Conversion using Fourier Transform
 -A Fourier Transform-based method was used to convert daily data into hourly granularity, helping models‚Äîespecially LSTM‚Äîcapture finer temporal patterns.

### 4.  Feature Engineering & Visualization
 -Created correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and time series charts to understand inter-feature relationships and improve model inputs. Key economic variables were selected based on correlation strength and significance.

### 5.  Model Exploration
 -Multiple models were trained and evaluated:

üü¢ Random Forest

üîµ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

üü° XGBoost

üî¥ LSTM (Deep Learning)

Each model‚Äôs performance was compared using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R¬≤ Score.

### 6. üåê Streamlit Integration

- The final solution was integrated into a Streamlit web app, allowing users to:

- Upload custom datasets

- Visualize correlations

- Train and evaluate models

- Download prediction results in CSV format
